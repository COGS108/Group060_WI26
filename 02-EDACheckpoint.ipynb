    "While the US is one of the major entertainment markets in the world, its entertainment market is becoming increasingly dependent on imported IPs, which is evident as we see a 17.9% increase in the US demand for imported content in film and TV shows from 2019 to 2025.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) A contributer to this demand is Japanese IPs. Japan is known for its sustaining IPs, which can be seen with franchises such as Pokémon and One Piece that continue to have major commericial success even through the decades since these series have been released. In fact, Japan‘s anime market alone generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by the mid-2020s, and is still expected to grow due to domestic and international demand.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) \n",
    "\n",
    "This raises questions about the strength of domestic US IPs, including major franchises such as Disney and Marvel. With the increasingly globalized U.S. popular culture, American consumers are continuously attracted to foreign media such as anime, gearing their attention away from domestic IPs. This drives us to explore which how the three factors that we have identified in our research question contribute (possibly differently) to the cumulative global revenue of these IPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no prior studies known to us that are directly related to our project. However, we did find some studies that can provide insight into the conclusion of our study. In 2025, the cultural differences between the marketing strategies by the United States vs the Japanese were explored.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The findings exhibited that the US marketing strategies included an emphasis on bold self-expression and straight-forward, relatable advertising tactics. On the other hand, Japanese marketing tactics put more focus on storytelling, culture, family, and simplicity. They also focus on highlighting the craftsmanship and quality of their products. This may have some relation to the importance of brand loyalty in Japan compared to America. This emphasis on long-term relationships can be seen through the long-lasting dominance of brands such as Sony and Nintendo in Japanese society–and even amongst many Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research exploring the behavior of both American and Japanese children and their relationship with advertisement showed that there were many differences between the two audiences.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) In America, the children were more skeptical towards the advertisements and are more susceptible to direct messaging and reasoning. They also are more attracted to products that market towards the benefits of a child. In Japan, children are more vulnerable to advertisements and watch much less television. This means it is harder for them to recognize when something is an advertisement. Japanese children are more susceptible to emotional messaging that puts a larger emphasis towards the product benefitting their family’s needs.\n",

    "Two years ago, the Japanese IP-driven Merchandising Market in only the United States was roughly valued at 19.2 Billion USD and has been projected to grow at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 11.7 percent.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) The catalyst of this significant rise would be the increased popularization of anime in streaming platforms like Netflix, Crunchyroll and Hulu. Meanwhile, out of the top 10 global licensors of 2025, 8 out of 10 of the companies were American.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) This includes the titan that is Disney–reaching 62 Billion USD globally.\n",

    "    This dataset was created using the TMDb API rather than downloaded directly, so it depends on how complete and accurate TMDb’s information is. Some search results may be loosely related to an IP, which adds noise to the data. Streaming provider information is also missing for some IPs, especially non-U.S. content. For example, Rilakkuma has limited provider data in TMDb despite being available on major streaming platforms, which may lead to its accessibility being underestimated."

    "### Global number of streaming platforms carrying an IP\n",
    "   1. Important metrics, what units they are in, and what they mean: \n",
    "      >This dataset was created using information from the TMDb API and looks at how easy it is to access different major entertainment franchises. Each row in the dataset represents one IP, such as Marvel, Star Wars, or Rilakkuma. The main metric used in this project is the number of streaming platforms that carry at least one movie or TV show from that IP. This value is a count, measured in number of platforms. The number of streaming platforms is used as a way to measure accessibility. If an IP appears on many platforms, it is easier for people to watch without needing a specific subscription. If it appears on only one or two platforms, it is more limited and harder to access. To calculate this, broad IPs were broken into individual movies and shows, and all streaming providers across those titles were combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Major concerns with the dataset: \n",
    "   >There are some important limitations to this dataset. The data was collected through many API searches rather than downloaded as a single dataset, so it depends on how complete and accurate TMDb’s information is. Some search results may include titles that are only loosely related to an IP, which adds noise to the data. In addition, streaming provider information is missing for some IPs, especially non-U.S. content. For example, Rilakkuma has limited provider data in TMDb even though it is available on major streaming platforms. Because of this, the accessibility of some IPs may be underestimated, and the results should be viewed as general comparisons instead of exact measurements.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There will be no human subjects in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is no freely available U.S. merchandise revenue data for individual IPs, for both Japanese and U.S. franchises, so we estimate merchandise sales using a simple formula based on a published report. This can cause some bias because the revenue numbers come from different sources and may not be fully accurate for every franchise. Streaming accessibility data were also collected using the TMDb API, which does not always list streaming platforms correctly, especially for non-U.S. or region-specific IPs like Rilakkuma. Because of this, the accessibility of some franchises may be underestimated. To help reduce these issues, we use the same data collection method for all IPs, compare our revenue estimates with other public sources, and clearly note known gaps and limits in the TMDb data while using Wikipedia and its listed sources as our main reference.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not be dealing with PII in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because our analysis focuses on franchise-level sales and engagement data rather than individual users, it does not involve protected demographic attributes. To mitigate downstream bias, we limit our conclusions to just market trends and will avoid making claims about specific populations or consumer groups (if it comes up).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data in this project will be stored in our group GitHub repo and will only be accessed by our group members. \n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The public may message any of our group members to request any data to be removed. Each of our group members will include our contact information in our profiles. \n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The repo may be kept online even after the class finishes. However, we are also open to deleting any data (or the repo for that matter) if deemed necessary. \n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this project, though we are looking at sales data, I expect that there will be a cultural aspect in it too that plays a factor in the success of Japanese IPs. We plan to educate ourselves into the marketing approach, which may be cultural, employed by the Japanese franchises. We may make connections to the Japanese consumer behaviors and to their success. We plan to incorporate insights from media studies, industry reports and fan community discussions to give conteext to our findings.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since our project has a cultural aspect to it, we will strive to keep our analysis to be as close as possible to be derived from the data only, and provide context like consumer behavior when appropriate.  \n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will strive to be as honest and as objective as possible when presenting our data through visualization. We will choose the best type of visualization/graphs to present our data. \n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> We will not be dealing with PII in this project.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will ensure that our analysis will include sufficient explanation as to why certain models or approach were taken. We are also using GitHub which keeps logs to changes made in the project. When making commits to our project, we will ensure to include descriptive commit messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will limit our use of proxies. But we think that the Google-Trends based trends to measure fan engagement does not present unfair discriminatory representation, it will not be a proxy for individual demographic characteristics such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status.We will also be using \n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Fairness testing across different affected groups is not conducted in this project, as the analysis is descriptive and does not involve predictive modeling or group-level decision outcomes.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use both estimated merchandise sales and Google Trends data because they measure different things. Sales estimates show how much people are buying, while Google Trends shows how interested people are. Using both helps us avoid focusing too much on just one metric, and prevents our analysis from being too one dimensional.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our methods are easy to explain because we use simple calculations and public data sources like Wikipedia revenue lists and Google Trends. This makes it clear how we compare franchises and where our results come from.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will clearly explain the limits of our project, including that our sales numbers are estimates, that global revenue data is used to approximate U.S. sales, and that Google Trends is only a rough metric of fan interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> No monitoring or post-deployment evaluation is planned, as this project is ONLY exploratory and we will not be deploying a model or generate real-world decisions.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project does not affect people directly. If someone raises concerns about our results, we would review the data and fix any mistakes or misunderstandings.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    ">There is no production model to roll back in this project. Any issues identified can be resolved by updating the analysis or data and rerunning the code.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We know our results could be misunderstood. To prevent this, we clearly explain that our numbers are estimates and should not be used as exact sales data or predictions."
