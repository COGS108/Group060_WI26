    "While the US is one of the major entertainment markets in the world, its merchandise sector depends heavily on imported IPs. The US anime merchandise market reached an annual revenue of several hundred million dollars by 2025, yet that represents only a small portion of the global anime merchandise market.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Instead, a large amount of US consumer demand for merchandise is met through imports from Asian countries such as Japan.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Japan is very known for its sustaining IPs, which can be seen with franchises such as Pokémon and One Piece that continue to have major commericial success even through the decades since these series have been released. Japan‘s anime merchandise market alone generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by the mid-2020s, and is still expected to grow due to domestic and international demand.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Specifically, Japanese anime IPs also constitute a substantial portion of cross-border merchandise purchases, showing their global appeal.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises questions about the strength of domestic US IPs, including declining major franchises such as Disney and Marvel. Many U.S. merchandise have shorter product lifecycles, being quickly outdated once media exposure declines. With the increasingly globalized U.S. popular culture, American consumers are continuously attracted to foreign media such as anime, gearing their attention away from domestic IPs. This raises the question of whether the lack of new, long-lasting US domestic IPs presents a gap in the US merchandize market or if the demand has already been met by foreign IPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025, the cultural differences between the marketing strategies by the United States vs the Japanese were explored.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The findings exhibited that the US marketing strategies included an emphasis on bold self-expression and straight-forward, relatable advertising tactics. On the other hand, Japanese marketing tactics put more focus on storytelling, culture, family, and simplicity. They also focus on highlighting the craftsmanship and quality of their products. This may have some relation to the importance of brand loyalty in Japan compared to America. This emphasis on long-term relationships can be seen through the long-lasting dominance of brands such as Sony and Nintendo in Japanese society–and even amongst many Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research exploring the behavior of both American and Japanese children and their relationship with advertisement showed that there were many differences between the two audiences.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) In America, the children were more skeptical towards the advertisements and are more susceptible to direct messaging and reasoning. They also are more attracted to products that market towards the benefits of a child. In Japan, children are more vulnerable to advertisements and watch much less television. This means it is harder for them to recognize when something is an advertisement. Japanese children are more susceptible to emotional messaging that puts a larger emphasis towards the product benefitting their family’s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years ago, the Japanese IP-driven Merchandising Market in only the United States was roughly valued at 19.2 Billion USD and has been projected to grow at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 11.7 percent.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) The catalyst of this significant rise would be the increased popularization of anime in streaming platforms like Netflix, Crunchyroll and Hulu. Meanwhile, out of the top 10 global licensors of 2025, 8 out of 10 of the companies were American.<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7) This includes the titan that is Disney–reaching 62 Billion USD globally \n",

    "Imported IPs meet consumer demand in the U.S. merchandise market. With the increasing popularity of Japanese media in the United States, driven by modern distribution and marketing techniques such as streaming and social media–driven promotion, imported franchises such as Japanese anime IPs have come to play a prominent role in U.S. merchandise sales and fan engagement. From 2023 to 2025, we expect Japanese anime IPs to consistently rank among the top-performing franchises in U.S. merchandise revenue and Google Trends–based engagement metrics. This would show that imported IPs, specifically Japanese anime, represent a growing component of the U.S. merchandise market alongside long-standing domestic franchise giants like Disney and Marvel."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because there isn’t freely available U.S. merchandise revenue data for individual IPs, especially for Japanese franchises, we estimate merchandise sales using a formula based on the Wikipedia global revenue list. This may introduce some collection bias since the revenue numbers are compiled from different secondary sources and may not be perfectly accurate for every franchise. To reduce this bias, we will cross-check our estimates with other public sources while using Wikipedia (with its credible listed sources) as our main reference.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because our analysis focuses on franchise-level sales and engagement data rather than individual users, it does not involve protected demographic attributes. To mitigate downstream bias, we limit our conclusions to just market trends and will avoid making claims about specific populations or consumer groups.\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data in this project will be stored in our group GitHub repo and will only be accessed by our group members. \n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The public may message any of our group members to request any data to be removed. Each of our group members will include our contact information in our profiles. \n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The repo may be kept online even after the class finishes. However, we are also open to deleting any data (or the repo for that matter) if deemed necessary. \n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this project, though we are looking at sales data, I expect that there will be a cultural aspect in it too that plays a factor in the success of Japanese IPs. We plan to educate ourselves into the marketing approach, which may be cultural, employed by the Japanese franchises. We may make connections to the Japanese consumer behaviors and to their success. We plan to incorporate insights from media studies, industry reports and fan community discussions to give conteext to our findings.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since our project has a cultural aspect to it, we will strive to keep our analysis to be as close as possible to be derived from the data only, and provide context like consumer behavior when appropriate.  \n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will strive to be as honest and as objective as possible when presenting our data through visualization. We will choose the best type of visualization/graphs to present our data. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will ensure that our analysis will include sufficient explanation as to why certain models or approach were taken. We are also using GitHub which keeps logs to changes made in the project. When making commits to our project, we will ensure to include descriptive commit messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will limit our use of proxies. But we think that the Google-Trends based trends to measure fan engagement does not present unfair discriminatory representation, it will not be a proxy for individual demographic characteristics such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use both estimated merchandise sales and Google Trends data because they measure different things. Sales estimates show how much people are buying, while Google Trends shows how interested people are. Using both helps us avoid focusing too much on just one metric, and prevents our analysis from being too one dimensional.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our methods are easy to explain because we use simple calculations and public data sources like Wikipedia revenue lists and Google Trends. This makes it clear how we compare franchises and where our results come from.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will clearly explain the limits of our project, including that our sales numbers are estimates, that global revenue data is used to approximate U.S. sales, and that Google Trends is only a rough metric of fan interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project does not affect people directly. If someone raises concerns about our results, we would review the data and fix any mistakes or misunderstandings.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We know our results could be misunderstood. To prevent this, we clearly explain that our numbers are estimates and should not be used as exact sales data or predictions.\n"
